# UWT-Initiatives
## The HTML site for the UW Tacoma Initiatives.

We purchased the HTML template [Engage](http://themes-lab.com/engage/overview) and started with that.
There are 3 main components to this little website:

1. Homepage uses the [Portfolio Grid w/ 5 columns](http://themes-lab.com/engage/portfolio-grid-5) 
    2. There is some customization here to allow for buttons to appear when the grid is filtered.
1. Initiatives by Impact Goal: List version uses [Feature Boxes](http://themes-lab.com/engage/shortcodes-features).
1. Initiatives by Impact Goal: Graphical version is based on [Onepage Restaurant Slider](http://themes-lab.com/engage/onepage-restaurant-slider) which heavily uses the included [Revolution Slider](https://www.themepunch.com/revsliderjquery-doc/slider-revolution-jquery-5-x-documentation/).

The Engage HTML template was shiny new in 2016 and it has aged a little bit, but I'm very happy with it, especially
considering it only cost $17.  Woot woot.
